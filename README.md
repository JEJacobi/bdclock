# Birth/Death Clock
A circuit that blinks for every averaged birth and death (inspired by xkcd's 'Frequency').

This was a simple circuit I made about a year ago to learn about EAGLE's workflow and
PCB design. All credit for inspiration goes to [xkcd](https://xkcd.com/1331/).

The 'birth' LED blinks at about 4.16 Hz, 14980/hr or 131 million/year.

The 'death' LED blinks at about 1.78 Hz, 6408/hr or 56.13 million/year.
